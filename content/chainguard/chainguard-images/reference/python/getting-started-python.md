The Python images based on Wolfi and maintained by Chainguard provide distroless images that are suitable for building and running Python workloads.

Chainguard offers both a minimal runtime image containing just Python, and a development image that contains a package manager and a shell. Because Python applications typically require the installation of third-party dependencies via the Python package installer pip, you may need to implement a [multi-stage Docker build](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/multi-stage/) that uses the Python `-dev` image to set up the application.

In this guide, we'll cover two examples to showcase Python container images based on Wolfi as a runtime. In the first, we'll use the minimal image containing just Python (which has access to the [Python standard library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/)), and in the second we'll demonstrate a multi-stage build.

## Example 1 — Minimal Python Chainguard Image

In this example, we'll build and run a distroless Python Chainguard Image in a single-stage build process. We'll first make a demonstration app and then build and run it.

### Step 1: Setting up a Demo Application

We'll start by creating a basic command-line Python application to serve as a demo. This app will generate random octopus facts based on a list in a text file. This app will use the `random` module from the Python standard library.

First, create a directory for your app. You can use any meaningful name and path for you, our example will use `octo-facts/`.

```shell
mkdir ~/octo-facts/ && cd $_
```

Create a new file to serve as the application entry point. We’ll use `main.py`. You can edit this file in whatever code editor you would like. We'll use Nano as an example.

```shell
nano main.py
```

The following Python script defines a light CLI app that takes in a text file, `octo-facts.txt`, and returns a random line from that file.

```python
'''Import random module to implement random.choice() function'''
import random


def random_line(text):
    '''Opens and reads lines of a UTF-8 encoded file, returning a random line'''
    with open(text, 'r', encoding='UTF-8') as file:
        line = file.readlines()
        return random.choice(line)

def main():
    '''Prints random line from facts.txt; verify your path'''
    print(random_line('facts.txt'))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```

Copy this code to your `main.py` script, save and close the file.

Next, pull down the `facts.txt` file with `curl`. [Inspect the URL](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chainguard-dev/edu-images-demos/main/python/octo-facts/facts.txt) before downloading it to ensure it is safe to do so. Make sure you are still in the same directory where your `main.py` script is.

```shell
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chainguard-dev/edu-images-demos/main/python/octo-facts/facts.txt
```

At this point, you can run the script and be sure you are satisfied with the functionality. It is recommended that you use a Python programming environment. Ensure whether you will be using the `python` or `python3` command.

```shell
python main.py 
```

You should receive the output of a randomized octopus fact.

```
The wolfi octopus was discovered in 1913.
```

The demo application is now ready. In the next step, you’ll create a Dockerfile to run your app.

### Step 2: Creating the Dockerfile 

For this single-stage build, we'll only use one `FROM` line in our Dockerfile. Our resulting image will be based on the distroless Python Wolfi image, which means it doesn’t come with a package manager or even a shell.

We'll begin by creating a Dockerfile. Again, you can use any code editor of your choice, we'll use Nano for demonstation purposes. 

```shell
nano Dockerfile
```

The following Dockerfile will:

1. Start a build stage based on the `python:latest` image;
2. Declare the working directory;
3. Copy the script and the text file that's being read;
4. Set up the application as entry point for this image.

```Dockerfile
FROM cgr.dev/chainguard/python:latest

WORKDIR /octo-facts

COPY main.py facts.txt ./

ENTRYPOINT [ "python", "/octo-facts/main.py" ]
```

Save the file when you're finished.

You can now build the image. If you receive an error, try again with `sudo`.

```shell
docker build . -t octo-facts
```

Once the build is finished, run the image.

```shell
docker run --rm octo-facts
```

And you should get output similar to what you got before, with a random octopus fact.

```
Octopuses can breathe and see through their skin.
```

You have successfully completed the single-stage Python Chainguard Image. At this point, you can continue to the [multi-stage example](#example-2-multi-stage-build-for-python-chainguard-image) or [advanced usage](#advanced-usage).

## Example 2 — Multi-Stage Build for Python Chainguard Image

In this example, we'll build and run a multi-stage Python Chainguard Image to demonstrate the process that includes a build image with pip and a shell, and a final distroless image. 

### Step 1: Setting up a Demo Application

We'll start by creating a Python application that will take in an image file and convert it to ANSI escape sequences on the CLI to render an image. 

To begin, create a directory for your app. You can use any meaningful name and path that resonates with you, our example will use `inky/`.

```shell
mkdir ~/inky/ && cd $_
```

We'll first write out the requirements for our app in the `requirements.txt` file. We'll download the most recent version of Python [setuptools](https://pypi.org/project/setuptools/) at the time of writing, and also install [climage](https://pypi.org/project/climage/).

```
setuptools==67.4.0
climage==0.1.3
```

With requirements declared, create a new file to serve as the application entry point. We’ll use `inky.py`. You can edit this file in whatever code editor you would like. We’ll use Nano as an example.

```shell
nano inky.py
```

The following Python script defines a  CLI app that takes in an image file, `chainguard.png`, and prints a representation of that file on the command line.

```python
'''import climage module to display images on terminal'''
import climage


def main():
    '''Take in PNG and output as ANSI to terminal'''
    output = climage.convert('chainguard.png', is_unicode=True)
    print(output)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```

You can now install the dependencies with `pip` and run the above program. It is recommended that you use a Python programming environment, ensure whether you are using the `pip` or `pip3` command.

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now you can run the program. Ensure whether you're using the `python` or `python3` command.

```shell
python inky.py
```

You'll receive a representation of the Chainguard Inky logo on the command line. With your demo application ready, you're ready to move onto the container stage.

### Step 2: Creating the Dockerfile 

To make sure our final image is distroless while still being able to install dependencies with pip, our build will consist of two stages: first, we’ll build the application using the dev image variant, a Wolfi-based image that includes pip and other useful tools for development. Then, we’ll create a separate stage for the final image. The resulting image will be based on the distroless Python Wolfi image, which means it doesn’t come with pip or even a shell.

Begin by editing a Dockerfile, with Nano for instance.

```shell
nano Dockerfile
```

The following Dockerfile will:

1. Start a new build stage based on the `python:latest-dev` image and call it `builder`;
2. Copy files from the current directory to the `/inky` location in the container;
3. Enter the `/inky` directory and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies;
4. Start a new build stage based on the `python:latest` image;
5. Copy the application and dependencies from the builder stage as well as any other files; ensure you're targeting the relevant version of Python;
6. Set up the application as entry point for this image.

Copy this configuration to your own Dockerfile:

```Dockerfile
FROM cgr.dev/chainguard/python:latest-dev as builder

WORKDIR /inky

COPY requirements.txt .

RUN pip install -r requirements.txt --user

FROM cgr.dev/chainguard/python:latest

WORKDIR /inky

# Make sure you update Python version in path
COPY --from=builder /home/nonroot/.local/lib/python3.11/site-packages /home/nonroot/.local/lib/python3.11/site-packages

COPY inky.py inky.png ./

ENTRYPOINT [ "python", "/inky/inky.py" ]
```

Save the file when you’re finished.

You can now build the image. If you receive a permission error, try running under `sudo`. 

```shell
docker build . -t inky
```

Once the build is finished, run the image with:

```shell
docker run --rm inky
```

And you should get output similar to what you got before, with a printed Inky on the command line.
