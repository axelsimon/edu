When you install Chainguard Enforce, you have the option to specify a *profile* that will determine what permissions Chainguard Enforce has over your cluster. Currently, Enforce offers two specialized profiles: `enforcer` and `observer`.

The `observer` profile has less expansive permissions, making it useful for running Enforce in a read-only mode. The broader permissions of the `enforcer` profile enable you to benefit from all of Chainguard Enforce's features, including policy distribution and enforcement.

This guide provides brief overviews of both the `observer` and `enforcer` profiles. It also outlines how to install Chainguard Enforce under each profile, as well as check what profile a given cluster is enrolled under.


## Enforcer Profile

`enforcer` is the default profile; if you install Chainguard Enforce without specifying a profile, the cluster will automatically be enrolled into the `enforcer` profile. 

```sh
chainctl cluster install
```

You can, however, specify that you want to install the `enforcer` profile by including the `--profiles=` option and passing it the `enforcer` value

```sh
chainctl cluster install --profiles=enforcer
```

Regardless of how you do so, when you enroll a cluster or other resource into the `enforcer` profile, it will also be enrolled into the `observer` profile. These profiles allow Chainguard Enforce to perform different actions, and the `enforcer` profile wouldn't be useful without the `observer` profile's scanning abilities. 

This means that when you enroll a cluster under `enforcer`, it will have all the same permissions as the `observer` profile along with a few more that give it broader access to a cluster, including the ability to enforce policies.


## Observer Profile

To enroll a cluster into Chainguard Enforce under the `observer` profile, include the `--profiles=` option followed by `observer`, as in the following example.

```sh
chainctl cluster install --profiles=observer
```

As its name suggests, the `observer` profile is essentially a "read-only" profile for Chainguard Enforce. When installed under the `observer` profile, Chainguard Enforce does not install an admission webhook onto the cluster. This means that Enforce will only be able to monitor the cluster and report violations; it won't be able to enforce policies or make any changes to your clusters. 

In some ways, the `observer` profile is similar to having [`warn` mode](../how-to-disable-policy-enforcement/) enabled. However, `warn` mode is set at the policy level. This means you can add `mode: warn` to certain policies, causing them to only return warnings, and leave it out of other policies that you want enforced. In contrast, the `observer` profile impacts the entire cluster; once you've installed Enforce onto a cluster under the `observer` profile, you won't be able to enforce any policy on the cluster.

Be aware that if you're setting up Chainguard Enforce to run both under the `observer` profile **and** in [agentless](../how-to-connect-kubernetes-clusters/#agentless-connections) mode, then Chainguard Enforce won't install anything on your cluster. In this case, Enforce will be able to `get`, `list`, and `watch` resources — excluding secrets — in order to scan what's running on the cluster, but it won't have permission to create anything on it.


## Checking profiles

You can check which profile a cluster is enrolled under with the `chainctl clusters ls` command.

```sh
chainctl clusters ls
```

This command returns a table listing your clusters. This example output lists three clusters enrolled into Chainguard Enforce under the same IAM group.

                     NAME                     | GROUP  |               REMOTEID               | REGISTERED |   K8S VERSION    | AGENT VERSION | LAST SEEN |   ACTIVITY     
----------------------------------------------+--------+--------------------------------------+------------+------------------+---------------+-----------+----------------
  gke_cgacademy-project_us-central1_cluster-a | tester | 5d8c0797-0733-44f9-a321-ea3e3f26468f |       142m | v1.24.9-gke.3200 |       7e170b0 |        2s |   enforcer:2s  
                                              |        |                                      |            |                  |               |           | observer:117s

                                              |        |                                      |            |                  |               |           |  observer:66s  
  gke_cgacademy-project_us-central1_cluster-c | tester | 78ba1a81-a2d7-4ea2-a11c-dbee4e9776d1 |       141m | v1.24.9-gke.3200 |       7e170b0 |       65s |  observer:65s  
```

The rightmost column, labeled `ACTIVITY`, indicates when a cluster's profiles were last seen as "active" by the agent. If a cluster is enrolled under the `enforcer` profile, both `enforcer` and `observer` will be listed in the `ACTIVITY` column. If a cluster is enrolled under `observer`, though, only `observer` will appear. The previous sample output shows that `cluster-a` and `cluster-b` are enrolled under both the `enforcer` and `observer` profiles, while `cluster-c` is enrolled solely under `observer`. 

You can also check the Chainguard Enforce Console to find what profiles your clusters are enrolled under. Navigate to the Console by going to [console.enforce.dev](https://console.enforce.dev) in your web browser. After signing in, there will be a table listing all of your clusters available to Chainguard Enforce.

The **Profiles** column lists the profiles that each cluster is enrolled in.


## Learn More

The `observer` profile can be useful for testing out Chainguard Enforce and understanding how it works. You can also test out Enforce on a per-policy basis with `warn` mode. Check out our documentation on [disabling policy enforcement](../how-to-disable-policy-enforcement/) to learn more.
