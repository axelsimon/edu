Change the behavior of the policies by letting the controller warn instead of failing

Configure it via a configMap for all the images not matching any defined policy https://docs.sigstore.dev/policy-controller/overview/#admission-of-images (explained in the last paragraph of this subsection)

An example of no policy matched:

    If the image does not match against any policy
    Fallback to deprecated policy-controller validation behavior
    Validation will be attempted against the secret defined under cosign.secretKeyRef.name during helm installation.
    If a valid signature or attestation is obtained, image is admitted
    If no valid signature or attestation is obtained, image is denied
