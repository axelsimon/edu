# This file is used to create temporary notices on pages on an as needed basis.
# For example when something is going to be deprecated, but has not been yet.
# To use it, add a YAML object matching the following structure:
#
# - title: "This must match the page title"
#   note: |
#     A line, or multi-line message with details.
#
#     The note can be plain text, or use Markdown.
#   type: One of NOTICE, WARNING, or DEPRECATED
#
# The 'type' field will render the div with the selfsame class applied.

- title: "Image Overview: jre"
  note: |
    This image will switch from including a full compliment of JDK binaries to a minimally required set in a forthcoming release. The work is being tracked in [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/chainguard-images/images/issues/297).

    If you rely on any binaries in this image that are not a part of the following list, you should switch to using the [JDK Image](/chainguard/chainguard-images/reference/jdk/overview/).
  type: WARNING
